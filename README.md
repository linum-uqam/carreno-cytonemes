# Cytonemes Carreno
Carreno project for cytonemes metrics extraction via 3D volumes.
Features volume data provided by UDM collaborators and all implemented metrics extraction pipelines.  

This repository is to reunite most of the Carreno project in one place.

# Project structure
Will try to respect [SCILPY](https://github.com/scilus/scilpy "SCILPY GitHub") project structure as much as possible.
